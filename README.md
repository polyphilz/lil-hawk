    Use GPT models to check for suspicious clauses in legal documents.<br />

# What is this?

lil' hawk is a Chrome extension that makes it easy to analyze legal documents and contracts such as Terms and Conditions, rental agreements and more.

# How do I use it?

1. Add text into the "legal copy" input box via the built-in selection mode or copy + paste
2. Add your OpenAI API key
3. Pick the GPT model to use
4. Find suspicious clauses!

# Why did you build this?

Recently, I was watching the first episode of Season 6 of Black Mirror, "Joan is Awful," in which the main character Joan has her life destroyed when her normal day is turned into a TV series on "Streamberry" (AKA Netflix).

I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers, but one of the things the episode got me thinking about is what kinds of crazy or dystopian stuff companies could be sticking into their Terms and Conditions and other legal documents that we sign all the time without really reading. It's scary!

The solution is definitely _not_ to start reading T&Cs though unless you're a masochist. But a summary never hurts right?

## Why not just use ChatGPT?

You totally can! I wrapped this up in a Chrome extension for convenience of selecting the text and having the prompt baked in.

## And the code?

A (somewhat) functioning MVP was made using [smol dev](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer). The [developer/ directory](./developer/) contains the files generated by AI before they were forked over to [src/](./src/) for continued development.
