    Use GPT models to check for suspicious clauses in legal documents.<br />

## What is this?

lil' hawk is a Chrome extension that makes it easy to analyze legal documents and contracts such as Terms and Conditions, rental agreements and more.

## How do I use it?

1. Add text into the "legal copy" input box via the built-in text selection mode or copy + paste
2. Add your OpenAI API key
3. Pick the GPT model to use
4. Find suspicious clauses!

## Why did you build this?

Recently, I was watching the first episode of Season 6 of Black Mirror, "Joan is Awful," in which the main character Joan has her life destroyed when her normal day is turned into a TV series on "Streamberry" (AKA Netflix).

I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers, but one of the things the episode got me thinking about is what kinds of crazy or dystopian stuff companies could be sticking into their Terms and Conditions and other legal documents that we sign all the time without really reading. It's scary!

The solution is definitely _not_ to start reading T&Cs though unless you're a masochist. But a summary never hurts right?

### Why not just use ChatGPT?

You totally can and should if that works better for you. I primarily made this to learn about Chrome extension development; along the way, I thought the convenience of the text selection mode and having the prompt baked in made the tool easier to reach for when quickly analyzing a T&C than opening a new chat with ChatGPT.

## And the code?

A (somewhat) functioning MVP was made using [smol dev](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer). The [developer/ directory](./developer/) contains the files generated by AI before they were forked over to [src/](./src/) for continued development.
